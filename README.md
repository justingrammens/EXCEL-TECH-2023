# EXCEL-TECH-2023
Slides and Examples From My [The Great Merge – How ML, AI, and IoT Are Coming Together to Create Industry 4.0](https://www.exceleng.net/resources/technicalconference/).

We’ve all heard of these separate technologies for not only years but decades in fact. However, this time, things are different. IoT is now providing a vast amount of data from sensors and equipment, not only in the factory but in the field. Advances in Machine Learning are giving us neural networks that can be trained and run on low-power devices and Artificial Intelligence is simulating human intelligence with Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. In this talk, I will discuss at a high level where each of these technologies came from and how together they are a force multiplier to create Industry 4.0.
